fractional is an extremely simple and light-weight CSS framework. It is designed to be modular, giving designers and developers the ability to use as much or as little of it as they choose. Looking for a grid system to help you quickly prototype a design? Look no further than fractional and its small, easy to understand grid. Maybe you're looking for some basic styling to go with that grid? fractional offers up a meticulously crafted stylesheet to get you started. The list goes on: fractional includes many larger components that would allow you to slap together an amazing site in very little time.

Created by Bryan King, fractional was created not only out of his frustration with bloated CSS frameworks, but as a way to put his front-end skills to the test. fractional is open sourced under the MIT license. Please feel free to use on any project, whether for profit or otherwise, I just ask that you give credit where credit is due. Interested in collaboration on fractional?
